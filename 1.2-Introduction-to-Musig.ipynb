    "In this chapter, we introduce the interactive [MuSig protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068.pdf) which allows n-of-n participants to jointly create and spend taproot or tapscript outputs using aggregated schnorr signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a signature aggregation scheme like MuSig has two significant advantages over using Script's `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and tapscript's `OP_CHECKSIGADD` opcodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transaction Size/Fees**: an aggregate MuSig pubkey and signature is indistinguishable from a single-key pubkey and signature, meaning that the transaction size (and required fee) for a multi-key output are the same as for a single-key output.\n",
    "* **Privacy and Fungibility**: an aggregate MuSig pubkey and signature is indistinguishable from a single-key pubkey and signature, making it impossible for anyone to use the public block chain data to identify where a multi-key scheme has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MuSig protocol covers both the initial setup (generating an aggregate pubkey for all participants), and the signing protocol (creating a valid signature for the aggregate pubkey). The signing requires multiple rounds of communication between the individual signers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bip-schnorr is linear in the nonce points and public keys, which means that public keys, nonces and signatures can be aggregated. A very naive multiparty signature scheme could be achieved by simply summing the individual pubkeys to generate an aggregate pubkey, each participant signing with a shared nonce, and then summing the signatures. Such a scheme would be vulnerable to both the [key cancellation attack](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/digital_signatures/introduction_schnorr_signatures.html#key-cancellation-attack) and private key extraction by exploiting weak or known nonces. Countering these attacks is what adds some complexity to the MuSig protocol."

Doing this ensures that no individual participant (or group of participants) is able to create a pubkey that cancels out other participants' pubkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge factor is unique for each participant, but all challenge factors are based on a hash of all participants' pubkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "No interactive round-trips are required in this step. As long as everyone can get all the public keys involved (through communication, a coordinator or offline) then they can compute the challenge factors and the aggregate public key locally."
